# Machine-Learning-and Deep Learning -Models-for-Computer-Vision-in-Space
Autonomous vision-based navigation is vital for future on-orbit servicing, but ML models are hard to train due to limited space imagery. SLAB provides specialized datasets enabling ML-based monocular pose estimation and tracking of known, non-cooperative spacecraft.
